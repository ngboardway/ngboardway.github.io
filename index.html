  <h2>Technical Background</h2>
</p>I was never into computers as a kid and didn't really learn about programming until college. I double majored in psychology and computer science at Hope. My big research project was the creation of an iOS application (Swift) to help teach budgeting skills to college-aged students with special needs. I also interned at an interactive design firm in Philadelphia that specializes in work with museums and other cultural organizations. (See the section about <a href="https://thelaurelhillcemetery.org/visit/tours-activities"> mobile apps</a> for some info on one of the projects they started while I was there...)</p>

<p>I have spent the last two and a half years as a full-stack (mostly web) developer for Ottawa Area Intermediate School District. The first two years were spent on a web app with an ember frontend && .NET Core backend. I recently started working on a new project- this one is a hosted Blazor Web Assembly application. </p>
